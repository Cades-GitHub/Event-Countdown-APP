# Local Events App.

The challenge for this Project was to create a app that uses at least two APIs.

As a group, we decided to have an app that can tell a user what events are happening in a city or town, as well as the weather for the event. 

To do this we gave the user 6 options to choose from. They can pick Concerts, sporting events even Expos. After the event was choosen, the user will enter in a city they want and a radius they want from that city. At the end they can pick the date for the event. Then a window will apear with results of the events they wish to attend.

Being over achievers that we are... We used 3 APIs for our App.

We used GeoCoding, PredictHQ and finally OpenWeatherMap APIs.

GeoCoding and PridictHQ uses a number of varibles to store references to HTML elements and data. These include latitude and longitude for a "Distance", a location input that allows a user to input an event for a city. As well as a "radius" input for more locations.

OpenWeatherMap uses a location and displays the weather conditions for that location on the screen.
